# React Native TodoList App
## Application to demonstrate and keep track of my evolution in using complex packages in react-native. Things including:
1. Creating simple UIs with StyleSheet, View, Text, ScrollView etc.
2. Adding touch capability to apps.
3. Adding Redux actions, reducers, configuring stores and dispatching actions.
4. Redux Debugging for React Native.
5. CodePush to push new functionality to users without going through App Store gymnastics etc
